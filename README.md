# Swift CommandLineKit

This is a library supporting the development of command-line tools in
the programming language Swift on macOS. The library provides the following
functionality:

   - Management of command-line arguments
   - Usage of escape sequences in XTerms
   - Reading strings on terminals using a lineread-inspired implementation
     based on the open source library Linenoise-Swift, but supporting
     unicode input, multiple lines, and styled text.
